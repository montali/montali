# Hello!ðŸ‘‹
Hi everyone, I'm Simone Montali, and I've been slamming a mouse on my desk since 1998. I recently graduated at the University of Parma in Computer Engineering (Ingegneria dei Sistemi Informativi), with a grade of 110/110 cum laude. I never liked settling so I have tried lots of things during my IT adventures, bricking included ðŸ™ƒ

# Technologies I really like ðŸ¥°
### I've been working as a web developer in the past years, building websites, plugins and themes with things like:
* PHP
* JavaScript
* WordPress
* React
* jQuery
* HTML + CSS
* Docker
### Even though I really like web development, it ain't my cup of tea. I am totally fascinated by artificial intelligence and machine learning, so in the last years I had the pleasure of working with:
* Python
* NumPy
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* fast.ai 

My first-level degree's thesis involved building a voice assistant for ER rooms to classify patients by their priority.
### Last but not least, I loved working with these bad bois:
* Linux/Bash
* Java
* C/C++
* LaTeX
* SQL
* MongoDB

# Technologies I don't really like ðŸ˜”
**These don't actually exist**. I'm ultra curious about things I don't usually work with. Hit me up with that knowledge!

# Other things about me ðŸ™Š
I'm a **HUGE** open source fan: good work can only be generated by **love** for what you're doing, and the best way of showing love is giving back to the community. When I'm not located between my chair and my desk, I like to define myself as a **petrolhead** and an **hiphophead**. There's just a thing I love more than my computer: my Honda Civic ðŸš™

# Let's talk!ðŸ‘‚
You can find me on a looooong list of social networks. These are the ones I don't feel ashamed sharing ðŸ˜¬
