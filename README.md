# Hello!👋
Hi everyone, I'm **Simone Montali**, and I've been slamming a mouse on my desk since **1998**. I graduated at the **University of Parma** in **Computer Engineering** (Ingegneria dei Sistemi Informativi), with a grade of 110/110 cum laude during 2020. I'm about to graduate with an **Artificial Intelligence** MSc at the **University of Bologna**, studying things like Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and their foundations.

After 5 years as an IT consultant for a small firm in my hometown, **I will start working as an ML SWE at Google in May '22!**

# Technologies I really like 🥰
I am highly fascinated by **data** and I think we will be able to progress further as a species thanks to its analysis. Because of this, my daily tasks are filled with:
* Python
* NumPy
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* fast.ai 
* SciKit Learn
* OpenCV
* PyTorch

My first-level degree's thesis involved building a voice assistant for ER rooms to classify patients by their priority.

### Sometimes you need to get your hands dirty, though, so I find myself fiddling with:
* Linux/Bash
* Docker
* Kubernetes/MicroK8s
* SQL
* JavaScript
* Java
* C/C++
* LaTeX
* MongoDB

# Technologies I don't really like 😔
**These don't actually exist**. I'm ultra curious about things I don't usually work with. Hit me up with that knowledge!

# Other things about me 🙊
I'm a **HUGE** open source fan: good work can only be generated by **love** for what you're doing, and the best way of showing love is giving back to the community. When I'm not located between my chair and my desk, I like to define myself as a **petrolhead** and an **hiphophead**. There's just a thing I love more than my computer: ~~my Honda Civic 🚙.~~ I sold my Civic, soooooo... Looking forward to the next one!🏎

# Let's talk!👂
You can find me on a looooong list of social networks. These are the ones I don't feel ashamed sharing 😬
